    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. 'this' will appear on the left hand side with a reference to an instance.
  2. 'this' will refer to an object
  3. 'this' is a reference, unless used within a 'constructor function' it will not reach out of it's scope.
  It will reference within the 'constructor function'.
  4. 'this' will always return 'undefined' within 'strict mode'. Strict mode requires precise code, so referencing the name of an object by using this within a function would not work. You would have to give the specific name of the object.
